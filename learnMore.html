                <p>Unity is positive, practical Christianity. We teach the effective, daily application of the
                    principles of Truth taught and exemplified by Jesus Christ. We promote a way of life that leads
                    to health, prosperity, happiness, and peace of mind.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Unity has established centers of study and worship throughout the world where people discover
                    and practice the Unity way of life.We address physical, mental, and emotional needs through
                    affirmative prayer and spiritual education. We serve those who seek inspiration and prayer support
                    as well as those who use Unity teachings as their primary path of spiritual growth. We believe that
                    all people are created with sacred worth, and we strive to reach out to all who seek support
                    and spiritual growth.

                    Therefore, we recognize the importance of serving all people in spiritually and emotionally
                    caring ways. Our ministries and outreaches are free of discrimination on the basis of race,
                    gender, age, creed, religion, national origin, ethnicity, physical disability, and sexual orientation.
                    Our sincere desire is to create spiritually aware organizations that are nondiscriminatory and support
                    diversity. We encourage you to explore and apply Unity teachings based on your own spiritual
                    understanding. We believe this spiritual understanding is enhanced through reflective prayer and meditation.

                        <p>The Silent Unity prayer ministry was the founding work of Unity. It originated in the heart of
                            co-founder Myrtle Fillmore, who, through her own spiritual awakening, was healed and began
                            to share her ideas and consciousness with others. Visit <a target = "silentPrayer" href = "http://www.unity.org/prayer">http://www.unity.org/prayer</a>
